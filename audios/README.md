# Gererate the .wav file

Convert the text to `.wav` file
```
python gtts_func.py -text "hello my name is jack" -out jack.wav
```

## 1. Attention
The file generated by gTTS derectly is not the real `.wav` file, so we need to convert it to the real .wav file

## 2. Check
Use this Linux command to see if the file is the real .wav file

```
$ file output.wav
```

If the output is like this, it means it's the real .wav file, so that we can feed it into the model

```
jack.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, mono 16000 Hz
```
